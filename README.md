# Wrap That Property

These are my experiments with the newly introduced PropertyWrappers in Swift 5.1

Currently, there are 3 wappers in the framework project, along with their tests - 

1. A monitoring value
2. A ranged value - with a fix range
3. A ranged value - with the property wrapper accepting a range to limit the value.
4. A string wrapper that trims all whitespaces and newlines
